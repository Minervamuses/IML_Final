# Wheat Disease Classifier üåæ

A project for classifying wheat leaf diseases using YOLOv8 image classification.

## üìÇ Files

- `wheat_training.ipynb` - Model training notebook (Colab)
- `webui.py` - Streamlit Web UI for inference
- `wheat.yaml` - Dataset configuration file
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This file

## üóÇ Dataset

This project uses the **Five Crop Diseases Dataset** from Kaggle:
- üì¶ [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubham2703/five-crop-diseases-dataset)

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The original dataset contains multiple crops. If you want to run this project with balanced class samples, it is recommended to use only the **Wheat** data, as it has more balanced class distributions.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the Dataset

1. Go to the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubham2703/five-crop-diseases-dataset) and download the dataset.
2. Extract the files and select the **Wheat** images only:
   - Wheat___Brown_Rust
   - Wheat___Healthy
   - Wheat___Yellow_Rust
3. Place these three folders in your `/training` directory.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model

1. Open `wheat_training.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.
2. Mount Google Drive in the notebook.
3. Run all cells to:
   - Split the dataset into train/val/test (80/10/10).
   - Train the YOLOv8 classification model.
4. After training, the best model will be saved as `best.pt`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Web UI

1. Download `best.pt` from Colab and place it in the **same folder** as `webui.py`.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the Web UI:
   > **Important:** Do NOT use `python3 webui.py` to run this program.  
   > You must use the following command to launch the Streamlit server:
   ```bash
   streamlit run webui.py
   ```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Notes for Colab Users

If you use **Colab + LocalTunnel** to host the Web UI, it will prompt for a **Tunnel Password**.  
This password is your **public IP**. You can find your IP by running the following in a Colab cell:
```python
!curl -s https://api.ipify.org
```
Copy the returned IP and paste it when prompted by LocalTunnel.

## üìå Notes

- `datasets/` and `best.pt` are **not included** in this repository due to size limits. You must generate them by running the training notebook.
- The model will classify images into: **Brown_Rust**, **Healthy**, and **Yellow_Rust**.
- The Web UI (`webui.py`) allows you to upload images and get predictions.
- For best results, it is recommended to use the Wheat data as it has more balanced class distributions.
